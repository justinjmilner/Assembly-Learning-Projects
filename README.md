# AssemblyLearningProjects
Welcome to my Assembly Language Learning Journey! This repository contains a collection of three beginner-level assembly code projects that I created while learning the fundamentals of assembly programming. These projects are a testament to my dedication to learning and mastering assembly language, showcasing my progress and problem-solving skills.

Project 1: bcd-addition - Performs Binary Coded Decimal (BCD) addition. Two packed-BCD numbers are provided in registers R16 and R17. The program adds these BCD numbers together and store the rightmost two BCD digits in register R25 while the carry value (0 or 1) is stored in R24. The code handles all legal BCD values without error checking.

Project 2: edit-distance - Computing the edit distance between two byte values stored in registers R16 and R17. The edit distance is defined as the number of corresponding bits whose values are not equal.

Project 3: reset-rightmost - Resetting the rightmost contiguous sequence of set bits in a given bit sequence stored in register R16. The result must be stored in register R25. For example, if the input bit sequence is 0b01011100, resetting the right-most contiguous sequence of set bits would produce 0b01000000. The program must work with various bit sequences and handle cases where there are no set bits or all bits are set.

These projects serve as a demonstration of my early exploration into assembly programming, illustrating my commitment to honing my coding abilities. Feel free to explore the code and documentation to gain insights into my journey and growth as an assembly programmer.
